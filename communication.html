      <h2>1. Leadership Communication Style Statement</h2>
      <p>As an engineering leader, my communication style is clear, respectful, and adaptive. I believe in giving precise instructions backed by context so that team members understand not only <em>what</em> is expected but <em>why</em> it matters. During project execution, I use a combination of visual tools (e.g., Gantt charts, diagrams), verbal walkthroughs, and documentation to ensure clarity.</p>
      <p>When facing conflict or disagreement, I take a calm, constructive approach. I seek first to understand the other person’s point of view before offering a solution. I apply active listening techniques and aim to turn disagreements into opportunities for process improvement or better understanding. I also ensure that conflicts are addressed privately and professionally to maintain team morale and respect.</p>
      <p>In diverse engineering teams, I adapt my communication to cultural backgrounds and varying language preferences. I avoid jargon, confirm understanding frequently, and check for feedback to make sure every team member feels heard and valued. I also use visual aids and written summaries when collaborating with globally distributed teams.</p>
